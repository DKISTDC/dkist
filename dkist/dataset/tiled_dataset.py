"""
Tiled datasets are one dataset which is made up of multiple smaller datasets tiled in space.

A tiled dataset is a "dataset" in terms of how it's provided by the DKIST DC,
but not representable in a single NDCube derived object as the array data are
not contiguous in the spatial dimensions (due to overlaps and offsets).

    Holds a grid of `.Dataset` objects.

    In the case where multiple images are taken in different locations on the
    sky and the images do not share a common pixel grid they can not be
    represented as a single `.Dataset` object.
    This class represented these tiled or "mosaicked" data can be regridded to
    be represented as a single `.Dataset`, but this involves some level of
    interpolation, so it is not always done by default.

    extract one or more `.Dataset` objects given their location in the grid.

        This class does not currently implement helper functions to regrid the
