ASDF File Updates
=================

This release of ``dkist`` includes compatibility with new metadata ASDF files generated after 2025/02/07.

.. warning::

   You should re-download all ASDF files when upgrading to this version of ``dkist``, particularly for VBI data.

These ASDF files change the ordering of the tiles inside a `.TiledDataset` object to correctly account for the differences between column-major (in FITS files) and row-major ordering (in numpy); this release of ``dkist`` updates the `.TiledDataset.plot` method to correctly plot these tiles in the expected order.
It should be noted that with new metadata ASDF files the indexing of specific tiles will have changed.


Dependency Updates
==================

This release of ``dkist`` includes both scheduled bumps to our dependencies as well as a special bump of gwcs to version 0.24, and associated dependencies.
