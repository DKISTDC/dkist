************************
v1.0 - We're out of beta
************************

The 1.0 release of the ``dkist`` package is the first release where we are declaring the package out of beta, and ready for general use.
First off this *does not* mean it's "done"!
There's still a `long list <https://github.com/DKISTDC/dkist/issues>`__ of things we know we need to do.
However, with this release we are confident that the core functionality works and you can search for, transfer and download DKIST datasets with the user tools.
When you inevitably find bugs and things that do not work please `open an issue <https://github.com/DKISTDC/dkist/issues/new/choose>`__.

What's in 1.0
=============

Normally in this part of the release announcement we would show off all the cool things which are new in the release, but *everything* is new!
Therefore, I will quickly highlight the core functionality included in this release.

Searching for Datasets
----------------------

The ``dkist.net`` sub-package provides a plugin for `sunpy.net.Fido` which allows it to search for DKIST datasets.
For a full tour of this functionality see the :ref:`dkist:tutorial:search-and-download` section of the :ref:`dkist:tutorial:index`.

Here is a really quick demo of searching for all unembargoed VISP data and downloading the first ASDF file in the results table.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
    >>> import dkist.net

    >>> res = Fido.search(a.Instrument.visp, a.dkist.Embargoed.false)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> res  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    <sunpy.net.fido_factory.UnifiedResponse object at ...>
    Results from 1 Provider:
    <BLANKLINE>
    84 Results from the DKISTClient:
    <BLANKLINE>
           Start Time               End Time        ... Average Temporal Sampling
                                                    ...             s

    ['.../VISP_L1_20220602T175042_BDWQK.asdf']


Reading Datasets
----------------

The ``dkist`` package implements two classes for representing a "Dataset", `dkist.Dataset`, and for observations with multiple spatial tiles, `dkist.TiledDataset` which is a collection of ``Dataset`` objects.
Any DKIST level one ASDF file can be loaded with the `dkist.load_dataset` function.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import dkist

    >>> ds = dkist.load_dataset(asdf_files)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> ds  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    <dkist.dataset.dataset.Dataset object at ...>
    This Dataset has 4 pixel and 5 world dimensions
    <BLANKLINE>
    dask.array<reshape, shape=(4, 490, 976, 2555), dtype=float64, chunksize=(1, 1, 976, 2555), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Pixel Dim  Axis Name                Data size  Bounds
            0  polarization state               4  None
            1  raster scan step number        490  None
            2  spatial along slit             976  None
            3  dispersion axis               2555  None
    <BLANKLINE>
    World Dim  Axis Name                  Physical Type                   Units
            0  stokes                     phys.polarization.stokes        unknown
            1  time                       time                            s

            4   no   no   no  yes


Working with ``Dataset``
------------------------

The `dkist.Dataset` is a subclass of `ndcube.NDCube` with some special DKIST-specific functionality.
For a complete guide to working with the ``Dataset`` object see :ref:`dkist:tutorial:visp-dataset`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # The dataset inventory record, containing core metadata
    >>> ds.inventory  # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> # A table of all the FITS headers
    >>> ds.headers  # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> # A lazy-loading dask array of all the data
    >>> ds.data  # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> # A helper for downloading FITS files
    >>> ds.files  # doctest: +SKIP
