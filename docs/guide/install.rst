Installation
============

To get started you should follow the `sunpy installation guide <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/installation.html>`__ as a working sunpy installation is a prerequisite for using the DKIST tools.

Once you have a working sunpy installation you should run::

  $ pip install dkist[all]

to install the DKIST tools.

.. note::

   Conda packages will be made available after the first official release of the package.
