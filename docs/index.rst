Getting Around the Documentation
--------------------------------

These documentation pages focus on the `dkist` Python package.
While we will introduce a little background information on the telescope and the data products, we expect that you already have an understanding of the scientific aspects of the facility and the data you want to work with.

The documentation is split up into sections:

* A very rapid introduction to the telescope, instruments and data products you can expect to work with.
* An introduction to working with solar physics data in Python and where the `dkist` package fits into the larger ecosystem.
* Tutorials on searching for, downloading and loading DKIST datasets into Python using the `dkist` package.
* A reference manual on all the attributes, functions and classes provided by the `dkist` package.
