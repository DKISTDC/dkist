DKIST Python Tools Documentation
================================

The DKIST Python tools provide a package (`dkist`) which aims to help you search, obtain and use DKIST data as part of your Python software.
The `dkist` package is a `SunPy Affiliated Package <https://sunpy.org/affiliated>`__, meaning we integrate tightly with the rest of the SunPy ecosystem, making heavy use of the `sunpy` and `ndcube` packages.

What to Expect from the DKIST Python Tools
------------------------------------------

The `dkist` package is developed by the DKIST Data Center team, and it is designed to make it easy to obtain and use DKIST data in Python.
To achieve this goal the `dkist` package only provides DKIST specific functionality as plugins and extensions to the wider SunPy and scientific Python ecosystem.
This means that there isn't actually a lot of code in the `dkist` package, and most of the development effort required to support DKIST data happened in packages such as `ndcube`, `sunpy` and `astropy`.

The upshot of this when using the DKIST Python tools is that you will mostly not be (directly) using functionality provided by the `dkist` package.
You will need to be familiar with the other packages in the ecosystem to make use of the tools provided here.
The main interfaces you will need to know are `sunpy.net.Fido` and `ndcube.NDCube`, we cover these in :ref:`dkist:tutorial:index`.
