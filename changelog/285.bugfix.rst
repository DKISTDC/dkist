Fixed coordinate reversal in VaryingCelestialTransformSlit2D._map_transform().

Rewrote cvt unit tests and ensured both imager and slit classes have 1D - 3D LUT table support and full round-trip
tests for the entire pixel table. There is lots of code duplication in the vct classes and unit tests.
This will be remediated with the refactor of the vct classes in issue 279.

Minor cleanup and reformatting.
