The ``dkist.data.sample.VBI_AJQWW`` and ``dkist.data.sample.VISP_BKPLX`` datasets have been renamed ``dkist.data.sample.VBI_L1_NZJTB`` and ``dkist.data.sample.VISP_L1_KMUPT`` respectively.
These names use the new Product ID which does not change when the data is reprocessed.
(Note that the VBI dataset has been reprocessed so the Dataset ID is also different.)
